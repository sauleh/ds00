tldr: We started the session by addressing internet disconectivity issues. Next, we analyzed the Heapify/BuildHeap algorithm and its applications. We then moved to disjoint sets and discussed a naive algorithm as well as an efficient algorithm with the union by rank huristic. Next session we will discuss the path compression technique and then move onto hash tables.
