tldr: We started off by explaining what a binary search tree is, whey we need it and how to perform basic operations. Next, we analyzed computational complexity of basic operations. We concluded with the need to maintain a balanced tree. We introduced the rotate-left and rotate-right operations. Next session we will will introduce the AVL tree.
