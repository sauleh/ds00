tldr: First, we looked at the C++ STL priority_queue class and then the heapq module in python to see how one would use a priority queue. We then discussed how one might implement it. Next, we looked at the Binary MaxHeap implementation and how it can guarantee log-n computational complexity for Insert and ExtractMax. Finally, we discussed how we can use a MaxHeap to implement HeapSort.
