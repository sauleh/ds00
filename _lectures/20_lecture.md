tldr: We started the session by discussion some academic dishonesties for programming assignments A2, A5, A6 and A7. The request is for students who have not honored the academic honor code to drop the course. We then reviewed HashTables and finally demonstrated uses of hash functions and their effect on hash table performance in .NET. We also reviewed the .NET implementation of hash functions of String, Int and Double.
