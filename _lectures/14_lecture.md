tldr: We spent the entire lecture on linked lists. After explaining what a linked list is, we demonstrated how it is implemented in C. Next, we demonstrated how it is implemented in C# while explaining the difference between value types and reference types. Finally, we explained how linked lists are used for memory management in the operating system.
