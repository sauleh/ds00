# Projects
This year we asked students to choose an algorithm or data structure and turn it
into a music. Ideally the music should correspond to actions in the algorithm and
its progress (inspired by this [medium post](https://medium.com/better-programming/merge-sort-how-to-understand-an-algorithm-by-creating-music-ruby-sonicpi-f68ee38d1a6b)). 

Three brave students took the challenge on and presented their work below. Congratulations to all!
